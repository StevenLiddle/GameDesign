How this game will work

Ideas---->

Random Dungeon Generator???
	Requirements ->
		Enemies is a MUST
		2D Dungeon Side-scroller to reduce amount of mathematics needed
		Fun Fun Fun
		Rendering Engine? Or rendered using text??
		Rendering Engine would look nice, but be hard, while text is crappy, but is easy to implement. (I'll attempt the rendering engine first, if that does not work, then do text)
